# Contributing to Repolore

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Repolore is a collection of agentic skills that help developers create content from their git commits.

## Project Structure

```
repolore/
├── _skills/                          ← CANONICAL skill definitions (edit here)
│   ├── using-repolore/SKILL.md       ← Parent skill — voice rules, shared conventions
│   ├── repolore-blog/SKILL.md
│   ├── repolore-x/SKILL.md
│   └── ...
├── .agents/skills/                   ← Installed skills for local agent use (don't edit)
├── apps/website/
│   ├── src/                          ← SvelteKit website source
│   └── static/
│       ├── skills/                   ← BUILD ARTIFACT — generated by sync script (don't edit)
│       └── install.sh                ← Installer script (ALL_SKILLS updated by sync script)
├── scripts/
│   └── sync-skills.sh                ← Copies _skills/ → static/skills/, updates install.sh
└── REPOLORE.md.example               ← Template for project configuration
```

**Important:** `_skills/` is the single source of truth. The `apps/website/static/skills/` directory is a build artifact generated by `scripts/sync-skills.sh` and gitignored. Never edit it directly.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ClavixDev/repolore/issues)
- Check if the issue already exists before creating a new one
- Provide clear reproduction steps

### Contributing Skills

New skills should follow these guidelines:

1. **Single-purpose** — each skill does one thing well
2. **YAML frontmatter** — `name`, `description`, and `allowed-tools` fields
3. **Depend on `using-repolore`** — content skills should load the parent skill for voice rules
4. **REPOLORE.md support** — read project context if available

#### Skill Structure

```
_skills/repolore-myfeature/
└── SKILL.md
```

#### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: repolore-myfeature
description: What this skill does. One sentence.
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*) Read create_file
---

# Repolore MyFeature

Load the `using-repolore` skill first.

## What This Produces

Describe the output format.

## Workflow

1. Load REPOLORE.md for project context
2. Analyze commits
3. Generate content
4. Present for review, then save
```

### Improving Existing Skills

1. Fork the repository
2. Edit the skill in `_skills/` (not in `static/skills/`)
3. Test the skill in your agent environment
4. Submit a pull request

### Website Contributions

The website is in `apps/website/` and built with SvelteKit:

```bash
cd apps/website
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build Process

The build runs `scripts/sync-skills.sh` before vite, which:
1. Copies all skills from `_skills/` to `apps/website/static/skills/`
2. Auto-generates the `ALL_SKILLS` array in `install.sh`

To build locally:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs where appropriate

## Code of Conduct

- Welcome newcomers
- Focus on what's best for the community
